# Gesture Recognition Upgrad Case Study

## Problem Statement
As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. 
We want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 
1. Thumbs up : Increase the volume.
2. Thumbs down : Decrease the volume.
3. Left swipe : 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
4. Right swipe : 'Jump' forward 10 seconds.
5. Stop : Pause the movie.

## Conclusion
The better accuracy for the problem is achived with CNN+LSTM model
